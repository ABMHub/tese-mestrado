In our work, we introduce \gls{LA-CDIP}, a document image dataset categorized exclusively by the layout information of the document image. This dataset enables \gls{VDM} research, providing a Zero-Shot alternative to the Document Image Classification problem. We benchmark this dataset by training siamese networks employing the \gls{LA-ZSL} approach on a diverse catalog of well-established visual backbones and compare their results with popular Large Language Models that require no additional training. We observe that \glspl{LLM} generally underperform compared to visual models. GPT-4o, on the other hand, achieves a slight performance gain over visual models. Still, it is hundreds of times more expensive per inference, making its advantage less practical.

There are some known limitations of the work and plans to tackle them. First, as mentioned, the complexity of an model architecture is currently an obstacle, as the dataset is relatively small. To solve this problem we work to increase its size, in number of samples per class and number of classes. We intend to increase the number of sources as well, gathering documents from sources other than the RVL-CDIP dataset, to increase generalization of  the trained models. This should allow effectiveness in the bigger models. We also plan to enhance the quality of the training pipeline. As mentioned, employing data augmentation techniques should relieve the necessity to expand the dataset, allowing the utilization of greater and more complex models. We also see potential in implementing batched contrastive-learning \cite{yang_batchsampler_2023}, and experimenting with custom document pre-processing.
