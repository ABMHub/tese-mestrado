This work introduces \gls{LA-CDIP}, a document image dataset categorized exclusively by the layout information of the document image. This dataset enables \gls{VDM} research, providing a Zero-Shot alternative to the Document Image Classification problem. The dataset is benchmarked by training siamese networks employing the \gls{VDM} approach on a diverse catalog of well-established visual backbones and compare their results with popular Large Language Models that require no additional training. Generally \glspl{LLM} underperform compared to visual models, except with GPT-4o, which achieves a slight performance gain over visual models. Still, it is hundreds of times more expensive per inference, making its advantage less practical.

There are some known limitations of the work and plans to tackle them. First, as mentioned, the complexity of an model architecture is currently an obstacle, as the dataset is relatively small. It is an ongoing work to solve this problem by increase its size, in number of samples per class and number of classes. Increasing the number of document sources by gathering documents from sources other than the RVL-CDIP dataset, also hold value as research, as it increases the generalization of the trained models, and is already mapped as future work. This should allow effectiveness in the bigger models. In the topic of the training pipeline, employing data augmentation techniques should relieve the necessity to expand the dataset, allowing the utilization of greater and more complex models.
